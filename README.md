### Application Associate @ Deloitte Consulting India Private Limited Bangalore, India
*September 2020 ‚Äì July 2022*

- Led automation of generating temporal business extracts; used ETL tools like Dataiku, Oracle SQL; reducing 50Hrs of manual work per extract and 75% of client expense.
- Spearheaded an interactive analytical dashboard to find a correlation between different databases from various data warehouses in python; reducing manual comparison by 25%.
- Developed ETL mappings to move data from multiple data sources into a data warehouse; simplified existing ETL mappings; decreasing run time by 15%.
- Led a team of 5 to develop Git pipelines for performing ETL using AWS Lambda, GLUE, Spark; cutting down manual work by 10hrs.
- Trained and mentored junior programmers in ETL methodologies; cutting down time for development by 20%.
- Directed various build activities aligning underlying architecture with business requirements, addressing business issues, data reloads, building data pipelines using Informatica BDM, AWS Glue, and Git pipelines.

### Machine Learning Intern @ Indian Institute of Science Bangalore, India
*May 2019 ‚Äì July 2019*

- Developed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) in upscaling a low-resolution scale 10 satellite image to a higher resolution scale 30 image; enhanced image detection performance by 25%.
- Designed a Super Resolution GAN using ResNet with skip-connections and loss functions tweaked to optimize the model.

## üìö Projects
- ### [Spotify Music Recommendation system](https://github.com/Oakseeker/Spotify_Music_Analytics_and_Recommendation_Engine), University of Colorado Boulder
<ol>- Spearheaded a team of 4 to fabricate a probabilistic model for the Song data obtained from Spotify API. Developed data preprocessing pipeline for performing essential Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Performed Feature extraction to enchance features and to develop a song recommendation engine using K-Mean clustering in R. The model performed with an accuracy of 75%. Performed regression analysis to predict the popularity of the song by using multiple song features. Created a dashboard using PowerBI to further enchance the useability of the project.</ol>

- ### [StockBuff ‚Äì Stacked Temporal and Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/Oakseeker/StockBuff-Stacked-temporal-and-sentiment-analysis-of-Stock-Market-Data), University of Colorado Boulder 
<ol>- Implemented Data Mining and market correlations to proactively predict stock market fluctuations using LSTM, mixed feature classifications and sentiment analysis.</ol>
<ol>- Deployed LSTM for time series analysis, NLP features for Sentiment Analysis and used ensemble model to boost the model‚Äôs prediction performance in predicting a stock price of a company.</ol>

- ### [Mutual Identity Authentication for Blockchain](https://github.com/Oakseeker/Blockchain-auth), Manipal Institute of Technology, India 
<ol>- Developed an authentication protocol for mutually authenticating between three parties in a public blockchain system at any given time; reducing by 75% of authentication time compared to existing systems.</ol>
<ol>- Led the implementation of a five-node public blockchain network using Hyperledger Fabric and Golang; applied Elliptic Curve Cryptography for developing an authentication protocol.</ol>
